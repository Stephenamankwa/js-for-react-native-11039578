TASK 1: file manipulation
Create the file `arrayManipulation.js` and define the method `processArray` in Task 1. An array of numbers is sent to this method, which squares even numbers and triples odd numbers. This change highlights the differences between even and odd integers in the final array.

TASk 2: String formatting
You will extend arrayManipulation.js in Task 2 by introducing format.ArrayStrings is a function that modifies strings according to matching integers that Task 1 processed. The function transforms the string to lowercase if the number is odd and capitalizes it if it is even. This demonstrates how string formatting is affected by numerical data.

TASK 3: 
In Task 3, define `createUserProfiles` and create a new file called `userInfo.js`. Two arrays are accepted by this function: Task 2's original names and its updated names. With the properties `originalName}, `modifiedName}, and auto-incremented `id}, it yields an array of objects. In order to format data for user profiles, this job combines manipulations from earlier projects, demonstrating practical uses for data transformation.
